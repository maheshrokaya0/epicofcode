Go, with its simplicity and efficiency, provides a robust set of standard libraries and third-party packages that are essential for web development. Below are some important packages that are commonly used in web development projects in Go.

## 1. UUID Package

```bash
go get -u github.com/google/uuid
```

The `google/uuid` package provides support for Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs). UUIDs are useful for generating unique identifiers in web applications, such as creating session IDs or primary keys for database records.

Example:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/google/uuid"
)

func main() {
	// Generate a new UUID
	id: = uuid.New()
	fmt.Println("UUID:", id)
}
```
## 2. Password Hashing

```bash
go get -u golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt
```

The `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt` package is commonly used for secure password hashing. Storing passwords securely is crucial, and bcrypt is a widely accepted algorithm for this purpose.

Example:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt"
)

func main() {
	// Hash a password
	password: = [] byte("mysecretpassword")
	hashedPassword,
	err: = bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword(password, bcrypt.DefaultCost)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
		return
	}

	// Verify the hashed password
	err = bcrypt.CompareHashAndPassword(hashedPassword, [] byte("wrongpassword"))
	if err == bcrypt.ErrMismatchedHashAndPassword {
		fmt.Println("Password does not match")
	} else if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Password is correct")
	}
}
```
 

## 3. ORM for Go

```bash
go get -u gorm.io/gorm
```
GORM is an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) library for the Go programming language. It provides a powerful and expressive way to interact with databases, enabling developers to work with database entities using Go structs and queries rather than raw SQL. GORM supports various relational databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and others. Learn more about it on [gorm.io](https://gorm.io/docs/)
